🎵 Data Mining & Pattern Discovery on Spotify Dataset 

Music Genre Classification, Clustering, and Association Rule Mining 
A Machine Learning & Data Mining Project by Amir Hassan 

📌 Overview
This project explores data mining techniques on a large Spotify dataset to uncover insights about audio features, music genres, and behavioral patterns. We applied clustering, classification, and association rule mining to not only classify genres but also find hidden relationships within musical elements.

🚀 Objectives
Classify music genres based on Spotify's audio features

Discover patterns and relationships through clustering and association rules

Predict the genre of a track using classification and rule-based systems

Analyze genre characteristics and the contribution of audio attributes

📊 Dataset
Source: [Spotify Tracks Dataset from Kaggle / UCI repository]

Size: ~15,000 tracks with 24 features

Features Include: tempo, danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, genre, etc.

🔧 Techniques & Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values

Applied outlier detection via IQR

Feature normalization and transformation (log/sqrt)

2. Clustering Analysis
Algorithms: K-Means, Bisecting K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

Evaluated using silhouette scores (Best: 0.452)

Grouped songs into distinct audio-based clusters

3. Classification Models
Algorithms: Decision Tree, k-NN, Naïve Bayes

Accuracy:

Decision Tree: ~51%

k-NN: ~58.5% (Best)

Used feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimization

4. Pattern Mining with Apriori Algorithm
Discovered frequent itemsets and genre-based rules

Achieved an average lift score of 17+ for genre-based rules

Example Rule: If acousticness is high and energy is low → Genre = Sleep

5. Rule-Based Prediction
Built a custom classifier using mined association rules

Achieved 96% accuracy in binary genre prediction (e.g., “Sleep” vs. others)

📈 Visualizations
Pie charts for genre distributions

Cluster visualizations (2D PCA plots)

Rule graphs showing item associations

Bar graphs for classification performance

🧠 Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, mlxtend, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebooks / Colab

🔍 Key Takeaways
Unsupervised learning reveals meaningful audio-based groupings

Association rules can enhance classification, especially in niche genres

Pattern mining is a valuable tool for understanding genre characteristics and user behavior
