# 🎧 Advanced Data Mining & Time-Series Analysis on Spotify Dataset

Genre Classification | Pattern Mining | Time-Series Forecasting | Deep Learning

📌 Overview
This project extends traditional data mining by combining machine learning, pattern discovery, clustering, and time-series analysis to uncover complex structures within Spotify's vast music dataset. The goal was to classify music genres, detect hidden audio trends over time, and implement AI-driven models for predictive modeling and feature importance.

This was part of our Advanced Data Mining coursework and showcases a full-fledged ML pipeline, including deep learning models and explainable AI tools.

🎯 Project Objectives
📊 Classify music genres using both traditional and ensemble ML models

📈 Extract patterns and motifs from time-series audio features

🧠 Apply deep learning (CNN, RNN) for genre recognition

📉 Forecast music popularity and genre distribution

🧩 Use SHAP and LIME for model interpretability

🔍 Analyze temporal behaviors in audio trends

📁 Dataset

🧪 Methodology & Implementation
1. Data Preprocessing
Merged track and artist datasets

Handled missing values with mean imputation

Feature normalization and encoding for ML

Final dataset: 938,597 records, 17 engineered features

2. Clustering Analysis
Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

Optimized K using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score (Best = 0.452)

Discovered 6 latent clusters beyond predefined genre tags

3. Genre Classification
Algorithms: Decision Tree, k-NN, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost

Achieved 58.5% accuracy (k-NN) for multi-class genre classification

Ensemble methods improved stability and generalization

4. Time-Series Pattern Discovery
Reduced dimensionality with PAA (Piecewise Aggregate Approximation)

Extracted motifs and anomalies using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Shapelets

Analyzed how audio features evolved over time per genre

5. Deep Learning for Genre Prediction
Implemented:

CNN for feature abstraction → 24.1% accuracy

LSTM for sequential feature prediction

MLP for baseline comparison

Input: Time-series extracted from audio feature windows

6. Explainable AI (XAI)
Applied SHAP & LIME for interpreting black-box models

Identified danceability, energy, and artist popularity as top predictors

Generated per-sample and global explanations for insights

7. Binary Classification - Track Popularity
Target: Popular vs. Non-popular (based on play counts/ratings)

Achieved 97.1% accuracy using XGBoost

📊 Key Results
Task	Best Model	Accuracy / Score
Multi-class Genre Classification	k-NN	58.5%
Popularity Binary Classification	XGBoost	97.1%
Time-Series Motif Extraction	DTW + Shapelets	Visual Insights Only
Deep Learning Genre Classifier	CNN	24.1%
Best Clustering Score	Hierarchical	0.452 (silhouette)
📌 Visualizations
🎯 Confusion matrices for genre classification

🔍 SHAP summary plots for global feature impact

📉 Line plots of time-series features by genre

📊 Bar and pie charts for genre distribution

📈 Cluster visualizations using PCA-reduced data

🧠 Learnings & Takeaways
Clustering reveals genre-independent groupings—some genres share audio characteristics

Time-series features help in understanding evolution of music preferences

Explainable AI is essential for model trust, especially in creative domains like music

Deep learning works best when large datasets and rich time-context are available
